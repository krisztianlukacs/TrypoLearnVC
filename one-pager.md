# AI-Based Learning Platform – One-Pager

## **🔍 Problem**

Students and educators are overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of academic content. Traditional learning tools are not personalized, slow to adapt, and often fail to provide real-time support or context-specific answers. As AI becomes integral in productivity tools (e.g., Cursor for developers), education still lacks domain-specific AI that can act as a real-time academic assistant.

For example: If the student can upload the course material before the course starts, in real time or the online course, the student can answer from the AI without interrupting the course leader or losing the flow of the course. Chat interface available for the students, so they can easily ask the AI on the course.

## **💡 Solution**

An AI-based learning platform leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide real-time, personalized, and syllabus-aligned academic support. It allows students and teachers to interact with university-approved materials via chat, generate exam questions, and fill knowledge gaps collaboratively.
