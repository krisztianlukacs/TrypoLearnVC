# Problem & Solution Fit

# **🎯 Problem & Solution Fit**

## **❌ The Problem**

1. **Overwhelming Information Overload**

    Students must process vast amounts of learning material (PDFs, lecture slides, notes), often without guidance, structure, or prioritization.

2. **Lack of Personalized Academic Support**

    One-size-fits-all education methods fail to address diverse learning styles and paces. Office hours are limited, and teaching assistants are overburdened.

3. **Non-scalable Teaching Resources**

    Educators spend hours creating quizzes, summaries, and grading. These are repetitive tasks that could be offloaded or enhanced by AI.

4. **Existing Tools Fall Short**

    Generic tools like ChatGPT or Notion AI are not tailored to a specific syllabus. They lack context, can hallucinate, and are often not permitted for academic use.

- **Accurate** answers aligned with approved sources
- **Contextual** responses grounded in specific course materials
- **Efficient** access to the exact content students need

### **👩‍🏫 For Students**

- Ask syllabus-specific questions anytime
- Learn in groups on shared documents
- Prepare for exams with AI-generated questions
- Personal AI tutor tailored to their university content

### **🧑‍🏫 For Teachers**

- Upload materials → instantly searchable for students
- AI helps generate quizzes, summaries, and explanations
- Track common student confusion points through unanswered questions
